measurements associated with each iris:
    length and width of pedals
    length and width of sepals 
goal: predict species of new irises from three different species:

    iris virginica
    iris versicolor
Data has 150 samples with 4 features each  
    sepal length
    sepal width
    petal length
    petal width
