measurements associated with each iris:
    length and width of pedals
    length and width of sepals 
goal: predict species of new irises from three different species:
    iris setosa
    iris virginica
    iris versicolor
Data has 150 samples with 4 features each  
    sepal length
    sepal width
    petal length
    petal width
Use k-nearest neighbors classifier
    to make prediction for new data point, algorithm finds point in training set, then it assigns label of this training point to the new data point
    k in k-nearest neighbors = instead of only using the closest neighbor to the data point, we can consider any fixed number k of neighbors in training    
        use one neighbor in this example
